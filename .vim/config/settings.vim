" Backups
"
" If you leave a Vim process open in which you've changed file, Vim
" creates a `backup` file. Then, when you open the file from a different
" Vim session, Vim knows to complain at you for trying to edit a file that
" is already being edited. The `backup` file is created by appending a ~ to
" the end of the file in the current directory. This can get quite annoying
" when browsing around a directory, so I applied the following settings to
" move backups to the /tmp folder.
"
" `backup` and `writebackup` enable backup support. As annoying as this can be, it
" is much better than losing tons of work in an edited-but-not-written file.

" Editing stuff in e.g. Docker containers breaks the symlink when done with Vim
" as it changes the inode number upon save. Setting `backupcopy=auto` becomes
" the middleground where Vim sees if it's possible to copy & rename without
" side-effects, if not possible, it runs with the same inode.
